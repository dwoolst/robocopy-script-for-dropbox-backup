# robocopy-script-for-dropbox-backup
I use this for backing up my dropbox. Why you ask? Using robocopy scripts with task manager has completely automated my local backups, 
and I can now leave my drive plugged in all the time because when its Unmounted its not readable so its safe from any virus the PC 
may acquire via Vidme pornorama or Russian hackers lol.
